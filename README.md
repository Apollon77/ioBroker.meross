**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors to me as the developer.**

## Description
This adapter allows to control Meross devices by connecting to the Meross cloud servers.

You need to provide your Cloud login credentials. The adapter connects to your cloud account and subscribe to all device data via MQTT. Because of this the devices need to be connected to their cloud. Currently no way is known to control the devices locally.

One Adapter instance will show all devices from one Meross Cloud account and allows to control them.

## Known working devices
* mss425e
* mss310
* MSS620 EU/UK


If more devices work (or also not) please report them by opening a GitHub issue.
