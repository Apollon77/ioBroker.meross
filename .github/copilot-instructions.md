# ioBroker.meross Adapter

ioBroker.meross is a Node.js adapter for controlling Meross smart home devices via the Meross cloud service. It connects to the cloud API to manage switches, outlets, sensors, and other IoT devices.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

Bootstrap, build, and test the repository:
- `npm install` -- takes 1-3 seconds normally, may take up to 30 seconds on slow networks. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 60+ seconds.
- `npm test` -- runs package validation and unit tests, takes ~1 second. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.
- `npm run test:package` -- validates package.json and io-package.json structure, takes ~0.5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- `npm run test:unit` -- runs deprecated unit tests, takes ~0.5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- `npm run test:integration` -- comprehensive adapter startup test, takes 30-60 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.

## Validation

- Always run `npm install && npm test` before making changes to ensure the baseline works.
- Always run `npm run test:integration` after making significant changes as it performs real adapter startup simulation.
- ALWAYS manually validate any configuration or main.js changes by running the integration test suite.
- When modifying translations, always run `npx translate-adapter translate` to update all language files.
- You cannot run the adapter directly outside of the ioBroker environment -- it requires js-controller.

## Common Tasks

The following are outputs from frequently run commands. Reference them instead of viewing, searching, or running bash commands to save time.

### Key File Locations
- **Main Code**: `main.js` (2368 lines) - core adapter logic, device handling, cloud communication
- **Admin Interface**: `admin/index_m.html` - configuration UI with Meross credentials form
- **Configuration**: `io-package.json` - adapter metadata, news, translation keys
- **Package Info**: `package.json` - dependencies, scripts, Node.js 18+ requirement
- **Tests**: `test/` directory with package, unit, and integration tests
- **Translations**: `admin/i18n/` with language-specific JSON files
- **GitHub Workflow**: `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

### Dependencies and Environment
- **Node.js**: Requires 18.x or higher (package.json engines)
- **Key Dependencies**: 
  - `meross-cloud` (^3.1.2) - Meross API client
  - `@iobroker/adapter-core` (^3.3.2) - ioBroker adapter framework
  - `@apollon/iobroker-tools` (^0.2.1) - Helper utilities
- **Dev Dependencies**: Mocha testing, release scripts, ioBroker testing framework
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: npm audit reports 11 vulnerabilities (form-data, tough-cookie, xmldom) from transitive dependencies. These are in dev/test dependencies and do not affect production functionality.

## Build Process and Timing

There is NO traditional build step - this is a pure Node.js project that runs directly from source.

**CRITICAL TIMING EXPECTATIONS:**
- `npm install`: 1-3 seconds (normal), up to 30 seconds (slow networks)
- `npm run test:package`: ~0.5 seconds (validates package structure)
- `npm run test:unit`: ~0.5 seconds (deprecated test)  
- `npm run test:integration`: 30-60 seconds (NEVER CANCEL - this starts ioBroker test environment)
- `npx translate-adapter translate`: ~0.5 seconds
- Full test suite (`npm test`): ~1 second

**NEVER CANCEL** any test commands. The integration test appears to hang but is actually setting up the ioBroker test environment with Redis servers.

## Validation Scenarios

Since this is an ioBroker adapter that requires cloud credentials, manual testing scenarios are limited:

1. **Package Validation**: Always run `npm run test:package` to verify package.json and io-package.json are correctly structured.

2. **Integration Test**: Always run `npm run test:integration` after changes - this is the primary validation that the adapter can start correctly in the ioBroker environment.

3. **Translation Updates**: When modifying admin interface or adding new configuration options, run `npx translate-adapter translate` to update all language files.

4. **Configuration Validation**: Check that changes to `io-package.json` maintain the required structure for news, version compatibility, and configuration options.

You CANNOT test actual device functionality without:
- Valid Meross cloud credentials
- Actual Meross devices registered to the account
- Running in a full ioBroker installation

## Configuration and Architecture

### Main Components
- **main.js**: Core adapter (~2400 lines)
  - Cloud connection handling via meross-cloud library
  - Device state management and synchronization  
  - Support for 30+ device types (switches, sensors, thermostats, etc.)
  - Polling for electricity/consumption data
  - MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) support

- **admin/index_m.html**: Configuration interface
  - Meross cloud credentials (username/password)
  - Optional MFA code input (30-second validity)
  - Polling interval settings
  - Local vs cloud communication preferences

### Key Configuration Options (io-package.json native)
```javascript
{
  "user": "",                              // Meross cloud username
  "password": "",                          // Meross cloud password (encrypted)
  "mfaCode": "",                          // Optional MFA code
  "electricityPollingInterval": 30,        // Seconds (min 30)
  "consumptionPollingInterval": 30,        // Minutes (min 10, max 35791)
  "noDirectLocalCommunication": false,     // Force cloud-only
  "onlyLocalCommunicationToQueryData": true // Prefer local for queries
}
```

## Development Workflows

### Making Code Changes
1. Run baseline tests: `npm install && npm test && npm run test:integration`
2. Make your changes to main.js, admin files, or configuration
3. Validate: `npm test && npm run test:integration`
4. If changing translations: `npx translate-adapter translate`
5. Commit changes

### Adding New Device Support
1. Study the device data patterns in main.js (search for device type names)
2. Add new case statements in the data handler switch block (~line 2100+)
3. Implement setValues functions for the new device type
4. Test with integration tests
5. Update device support documentation

### Modifying Admin Interface
1. Edit `admin/index_m.html` for UI changes
2. Update `admin/i18n/en/translations.json` for new text
3. Run `npx translate-adapter translate` to update all languages
4. Test admin interface in ioBroker environment

## Important Notes

- **Cloud Dependencies**: This adapter requires internet connectivity and valid Meross cloud credentials
- **No Local-Only Mode**: Devices must be connected to Meross cloud service
- **MFA Challenges**: MFA codes are only valid for 30 seconds - enter and save quickly
- **Token Storage**: Login tokens are stored and reused to minimize login frequency
- **Device Addition**: New devices require adapter restart to update the device tree
- **Debugging**: Set adapter to Debug mode and check ioBroker logs for troubleshooting

## GitHub Workflows

The project uses `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`:
- **check-and-lint**: Quick validation on Node 22.x
- **adapter-tests**: Full testing on Node 18.x, 20.x, 22.x, 24.x across ubuntu/windows/macos
- **deploy**: Automated NPM publishing on tagged releases

Tests run automatically on pushes and pull requests. The workflow includes package validation, unit tests, and integration tests across multiple environments.
